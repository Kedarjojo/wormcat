The provided R code constitutes a comprehensive analysis pipeline using the DESeq2 package for RNA-seq data. The initial steps involve reading count data from an Excel file, extracting gene IDs, and converting the data into a suitable format. Metadata for DESeq is then incorporated, ensuring compatibility with the count data. The DESeqDataSet object is created, and size factors for normalization are estimated. Normalized counts are saved to a CSV file, and principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to inspect sample relationships. Dispersion estimation and subsequent DESeq analysis are conducted, leading to Wald tests for differential expression between various conditions. The results, including p-values and fold changes, are meticulously written to separate CSV files for each pairwise comparison. Visualizations, such as MA plots and histograms of p-values, aid in interpreting the findings. The script concludes by combining the results with gene IDs and saving them to a CSV file.
Further, the gene ids are analysed via KEGG and GO pathways to analyse the pathways.
